Facebook page scrawler using Graph API for digital marketing purposes

Project for my friend who is currently working in digital marketing fields.
When I saw him paying and using <http://crowdbabble.com/>, I felt like I could do better, for free.
Right now this project only supports Facebook page, using Facebook Graph API.
First I tried to use open source facebook scrapper such as [Facebook-Page-Crawler](https://github.com/chenjr0719/Facebook-Page-Crawler).
But soon I found that they are not making full use of graphql and make hundreds of api requests. 
Graphql excels rest api in such a way that they could do so much in one single query. 
This project minimizes the number of queries between Facebook and the user.

Still on process of improving based on the feedback of my friend, Tatch.
